        <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
        <p>
          In this game, you will play with Panda. First of all, you enter the
          name and enroll your name, and then you are ready to play the game.
          then you have to guess the number that Panda said. If you correctly
          guess the Panda said number within the 10 chances, then you will have
          won the game. Every chance Panda says the different number. The panda
          only says 1 to 10 numbers. If you do not guess that Panda number
          within 10 chances, you will have lost the game.
